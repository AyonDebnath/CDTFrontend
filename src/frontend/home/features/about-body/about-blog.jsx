          <h4>Our Goal: -for CDT</h4>
          <p>
            CDT intends to become a global force that offers a platform for both
            students and instructors to benefit as we create a virtual space
            that offers information and resources in-keeping with your driving
            needs
          </p>
          <h4>Our Goal: -for Students</h4>
          <p>
            CHere at CDT we intend to suer-pass all the expectations and break
            through the status-quo that gives dilapidated driver training
            experience to our people, all are entitled to affordable driver
            training that is at the highest level and I will use our years of
            instructor training experience to raise the standard for all to
            benefit We values professionalism at all levels, therefore we offer
            and deliver to each individual Skilled training that is of the
            highest standard Respect (that transcends marginalization or
            segregation) with all persons throughout your time spent with us
            here at CDT and beyond We also avail to you a safe environment for
            learning that is second to none, you can be assured on our efforts
            in regards to a secure space with well trained and experienced
            instructor who has the knowledge, skills and techniques to help you
            learn, no matter the level. Contrary to the disclaimer that we are
            perfect, we only strive for perfection daily to become the best
            option in Newfoundland and eventually throughout Canada, one of our
            strengths are that we learn from you at each lesson we conduct and
            for each feedback you give …we use to make ourselves better for your
            Benefit

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Training has been offered to new and first-time drivers with no
              regards to how they will function in the real life environment (We
              at CDT intend to change that, we will give a mixture of test
              conditions and real life scenarios)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Training has been geared to mainly pass the road test also only
              using a particular school car that does not give students a wider
              range of expertise (We at CDT intend to change that idea, at the
              end of your training you will be able to do your road test using
              our car or any car of yours choice in any test area of your choice
              and be successful)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Training has been done without consideration to people’s budget,
              there is no way students should be faced with the additional
              burden of high hourly fees.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            One of the burden we carry as a school is that we intend to change
            the Status quo of the way training is being offered to individuals
